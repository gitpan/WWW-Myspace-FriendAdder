Revision history for WWW-Myspace-FriendAdder

0.12    2007-06-29
        Module split from WWW::Myspace distribution
        Moved WWW::Myspace::Data from a "use" to a "require" statement to 
        remove that dependency in WWW::Myspace::FriendAdder
        Added examples/friend_adder.pl to  with accompanying 
        examples/adder.cfg file
        Updated tests so that Myspace login is not required
